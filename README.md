# Note Applications

Design process in notes.

## Class Discussion
Notes taken as a class (8:30 - 9:15am)

### Uses
- Taking notes in class
- Daily todo list
- Reminders
- Sketching / drawing
- Articles to read (offline reading)

### Challenges
- Filing notes in a way that I will remember down the road
  - Hacking it: "What will I search the next time Im looking for this"
- Combining sketches and notes is difficult
- Portability of proper sketching tools is limiting
- Organization is a priority
- Similar topics across multiple docs not organized
- Overwhelming amount of notes that I could not possibly go back on

### Class Note Taking Application
Into two teams of three, discuss (and take notes) the needs for a student who is struggling with taking and using digital notes in the classroom (can be specific to this program or general student)
- What are YOUR needs as a student?
- Where are current applications not serving those needs?
- Try sketching a few possible interfaces


## Group Discussion
Notes taken in groups (9:15-9:45am)

### Group Left


### Group Right
