# Note Applications

Design process in notes.

## Class Discussion
Notes taken as a class (8:30 - 9:15am)

### Uses
- Taking notes in class
- Daily todo list
- Reminders
- Sketching / drawing
- Articles to read (offline reading)

### Challenges
- Filing notes in a way that I will remember down the road
  - Hacking it: "What will I search the next time Im looking for this"
- Combining sketches and notes is difficult
- Portability of proper sketching tools is limiting
- Organization is a priority
- Similar topics across multiple docs not organized
- Overwhelming amount of notes that I could not possibly go back on

### Class Note Taking Application
Into two teams of three, discuss (and take notes) the needs for a student who is struggling with taking and using digital notes in the classroom (can be specific to this program or general student)
- What are YOUR needs as a student?
- Where are current applications not serving those needs?
- Try sketching a few possible interfaces


## Group Discussion
Notes taken in groups (9:15-9:45am)

### Group Left


### Group Right

- The notes app will be robust, allowing different types of content in one note.
  - Scanning/inserting an image
  - Using the camera for photos + videos
  - Being able to markup the content using the tools in the app
  - Sketching: freehand sketches should be possible, with different tool options
  - Free flowing, being able to fluently switch between different content through one note


- Sketching in notes is very important
- Ability to use pens, markers, and other tools
  - Select tools and sizes, colour, etc.

- Searchability of notes is important, using keywords, possibly tagging of notes (automagically???)
  - Should be able to seach any word in the note and find it
  - OCR 
- Organizing of notes into clusters/folders --> also automagically???
  - Could pull keywords from notes and match across other notes to find similarities and suggest groupings
- Sorting and heirarchy of notes, and naming automatically (based off first line in note)

- Syncing to cloud, being able to access from different devices (live update?) 
- Collaborating, being able to share and send notes, as well as being able to work on same note at the same time
